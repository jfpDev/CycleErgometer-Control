# CycleErgometer-Control
This code manages an LCD display and a power circuit. It has been set up to use it easily in other projects. 

If you want to know which were the lines of code, just un-commit the changes. 

This code was used in controling a Cycle-Ergometer medical equipment by showing the RPM and levels of mechanical effort a patient
has to do in order to sense different heart signals. You are open to use it in your own projects and do not forget to credit! 

Thank you, and enjoy.
